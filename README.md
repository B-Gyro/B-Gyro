# Kernel From Scratch [B-Gyro]
Hey there! Welcome to our **Kernel From Scratch (KFS)** project. This started out as part of the **42 Network** curriculum, where we’re building an OS kernel from scratch. But here’s the fun part: we’re not just sticking to the basics. We’re adding our own features, customizing it, and going above and beyond the requirements.

Think of it as a fun, experimental project where we’re diving deeper into the world of systems programming and learning along the way. We’re taking the opportunity to add our own spin, explore new ideas, and build something that’s truly ours.
